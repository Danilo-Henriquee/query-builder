That is a library i'm developing to improve the query of the systems of my company. I getting worried about how poor code is writed in the system, how someone can write the worst code i've ever seen my life and tell 
me just continue doing that, really? And regarding the model i'm using to do this, why i'm not using string literals and pass to the MySQLI library of PHP? It's simple, is an inspiration in functional programming and
the best practices of the clean code. Bob tell me i need to merge the best practices in my day-to-day to become an better programmer.
Is verbous? Yes. But is the best way i've found to write code, breaking parameters in object and turn to a reusable and some more. 

Look, i'm trying okay? Is the best thing i can do with my little experience, is not perfect. If you want to contribue with your experience i'm accepting of course.
